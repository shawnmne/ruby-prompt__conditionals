# What is a conditional?

A conditional in Ruby is used to control flow of a program by way of using if, elsif, and else statements.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

'=' I will call an assigner.  It is used often to assign a variable to a value or a string.  It can also be used to create an array or hash.
name = "shawn"
age = 48

'==' I will call an equality checker.  It is often used in conjuction with an if staement. It compares what is on the left and right and if they are the same then some code is run.
if age == 48
  puts "You are 48."
